# ‚ö° WattsUp ‚Äì Energy Spike Anomaly Detection

An end-to-end Machine Learning project to detect abnormal energy spikes from smart meter data using ML algorithms. The project includes a trained model, an interactive web dashboard, and deployment.

## üöÄ Features
- Detect abnormal usage spikes in energy data
- Visualize spikes using an interactive dashboard
- Upload CSV files to check for anomalies
- Deployable web application

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- ML: Isolation Forest, Time Series EDA
- Flask for backend
- HTML/CSS + Chart.js (for frontend visualization)
- Deployment via Render or Railway

## üìÅ Folder Structure
- `data/` - contains raw and processed data
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for EDA + modeling
- `model/` - trained ML model files
- `app/` - Flask backend and HTML templates

## ‚úÖ Progress Log

### Day 1
- Initialized GitHub repository and base project folder structure

### Day 2
- Performed time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet
- Cleaned and resampled electricity usage data to daily totals
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Plotted daily electricity consumption over time
- Trained a time series model using Facebook Prophet
- Forecasted energy usage for the next 30 days
- Plotted forecast results including confidence intervals
- Analyzed trend and weekly patterns using Prophet components
- Saved the forecasting notebook to GitHub
