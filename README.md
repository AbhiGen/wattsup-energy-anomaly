## 🚀 Features
- Detect abnormal usage spikes in energy data
- Visualize spikes using an interactive dashboard
- Upload CSV files to check for anomalies
- Deployable web application

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- ML: Isolation Forest, Time Series EDA
- Flask for backend
- HTML/CSS + Chart.js (for frontend visualization)
- Deployment via Render or Railway

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/` - contains raw and processed data
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for EDA + modeling
- `model/` - trained ML model files
- `app/` - Flask backend and HTML templates

## ✅ Status
Day 1: Initialized repository and base project structure
